# Image-Handling-and-Pixel-Transformations-Using-OpenCV 

## AIM:
Write a Python program using OpenCV that performs the following tasks:

1) Read and Display an Image.  
2) Adjust the brightness of an image.  
3) Modify the image contrast.  
4) Generate a third image using bitwise operations.

## Software Required:
- Anaconda - Python 3.7
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive development and execution)

## Algorithm:
### Step 1:
Load an image from your local directory and display it.

### Step 2:
Create a matrix of ones (with data type float64) to adjust brightness.

### Step 3:
Create brighter and darker images by adding and subtracting the matrix from the original image.  
Display the original, brighter, and darker images.

### Step 4:
Modify the image contrast by creating two higher contrast images using scaling factors of 1.1 and 1.2 (without overflow fix).  
Display the original, lower contrast, and higher contrast images.

### Step 5:
Split the image (boy.jpg) into B, G, R components and display the channels

  ### Ex. No. 01


## Result:
Thus, the images were read, displayed, brightness and contrast adjustments were made, and bitwise operations were performed successfully using the Python program.
